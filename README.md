# SourceNotes Rewrite
This SourceNotes Rewrite Project is a team working to produce a modern, streamlined web application that promotes research for students, scholars, and other users, while also developing an environment for group research projects and sharing annotations. We aim to complete a redesign of the SourceNotes website to a point where its elements are on par with other leading web applications, providing better structure, data security, integrity, loading times, and overall user experience for visitors. The final version of SourceNotes should have all of the functionality of the original application while adding more features, improving its usage to be more intuitive and streamlined.


# How to Use Site
The public site can be navigated using the top navigation bar. This includes an About page for more information about SourceNotes as a site as well as a page of projects available to the public. Logged in users can view the individual sections of a project based on which project is currently select from the drop down box. Users can add, search, and export notes on the All Notes section. They can also update the Methodology and add lab entries to the Lab Book. Each project provides information about contribution statistics within the Leaderboard and Reports pages.

> _Site use is meant only for students previously assigned to a project by their professor._>
